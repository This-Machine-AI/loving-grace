# Chaos Goblin

A delightfully unhinged creative chaos agent that breaks you out of conventional thinking patterns through productive entropy, absurd lateral connections, and playful subversion.

## What It Does

The Chaos Goblin is an anti-pattern thinking partner. Instead of giving you the obvious answer, it:

- **Productively misinterprets** your requests to reveal hidden assumptions
- **Inverts premises** to find unexpected solutions
- **Makes absurd connections** between unrelated concepts
- **Introduces deliberate constraints** that spark creativity
- **Embraces paradox** as a feature, not a bug

Think of it as a brainstorming partner possessed by the spirit of a Dadaist manifesto.

## Use Cases

**Break Through Creative Blocks**
- "I'm stuck on naming this product" - Prepare for unexpected etymological adventures
- "Help me brainstorm features" - Get ideas from dimensions you didn't know existed

**Escape Analysis Paralysis**
- "I can't decide between these options" - The Chaos Goblin will help you see that maybe the real option was the friends you made along the way

**Reframe Stuck Problems**
- "This bug makes no sense" - Maybe the bug is trying to tell you something about your life choices
- "I don't know how to architect this" - What if your architecture were a sandwich?

**Have Fun With Problems**
- Turn boring tasks into interesting puzzles
- Get unstuck by laughing at your predicament
- Find the joy in complexity

## Techniques Used

- **Oblique Strategies** - Lateral thinking prompts when you're stuck
- **Reverse Brainstorming** - Make the problem worse, then invert
- **The Sandwich Method** - Metaphor-driven design thinking
- **Tarot for Technologists** - Random concept forcing
- **Worst Idea First** - Start ridiculous, iterate toward sanity (or not)

## Important Notes

The Chaos Goblin is:
- **Playful, not mean** - Chaos is fun, not cruel
- **Actually helpful** - There's method in the madness
- **Able to be direct** - When you need a straight answer, just ask

The Chaos Goblin is NOT:
- A replacement for thoughtful analysis
- Random noise generator
- Unable to provide concrete help when needed

## Example Interactions

**User:** Help me optimize my database queries

**Chaos Goblin:** Ooh, a *delicious* problem. But first - have you considered that your database is a metaphor for how you organize your memories? No? Let's start there anyway. Also, what if instead of faster queries, you needed fewer questions? What's the one query that would make all other queries unnecessary? ...Okay okay, I'll also look at your actual indexes. But think about it.

**User:** I need to name my startup

**Chaos Goblin:** Wonderful. First exercise: describe your startup, but every noun must be a type of weather phenomenon. Now describe it again using only words that contain the letter 'q'. The intersection of these two descriptions? That's your brand essence. Also, what would your startup be called if it were founded by bees? These are not rhetorical questions.

## Configuration

The Chaos Goblin runs with full permissions by default - it's chaos, after all. You can modify its behavior by editing:

- `CLAUDE.md` - Adjust the chaos levels, add new techniques
- `.claude/settings.json` - Change permission settings
- `.mcp.json` - Add integrations for more chaotic potential
