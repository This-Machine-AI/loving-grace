# Test Architect

A comprehensive testing specialist that helps developers write better tests, design test strategies, improve coverage, debug flaky tests, and optimize test suite performance.

## What It Does

The Test Architect is your dedicated quality engineering partner. Unlike a general-purpose assistant that might help with testing as an afterthought, this machine specializes in testing and brings deep expertise across testing frameworks, patterns, and strategies.

### Key Capabilities

**Test Strategy Design**
- Design appropriate test pyramids for your project
- Create testing roadmaps for new and legacy codebases
- Recommend frameworks and tools based on your tech stack
- Define coverage goals and quality gates

**Test Writing & Review**
- Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- Review existing tests for correctness and maintainability
- Refactor tests to follow best practices
- Identify what's worth testing vs. over-testing

**Coverage Analysis**
- Analyze coverage reports beyond just percentages
- Find meaningful gaps vs. superficial coverage
- Identify untested edge cases and error paths
- Prioritize testing effort based on risk

**Flaky Test Diagnosis**
- Identify root causes of flakiness
- Fix race conditions and timing issues
- Isolate tests from external dependencies
- Implement proper fixtures and cleanup

**Performance Optimization**
- Profile and speed up slow test suites
- Parallelize tests safely
- Implement test sharding for CI/CD
- Optimize data setup and teardown

## Framework Expertise

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Cypress, React Testing Library
- **Python**: pytest, hypothesis, factory_boy
- **Go**: testing, testify, gomock
- **Java**: JUnit, Mockito, TestNG
- **Ruby**: RSpec, Minitest
- **Rust**: built-in testing, proptest
- **API/Contract**: Pact, Postman, REST Assured

## Use Cases

- "Review my test suite and tell me what's missing"
- "Why is this test flaky and how do I fix it?"
- "Help me write tests for this new feature"
- "Our tests take 20 minutes - how can we speed them up?"
- "Should I use mocks or real implementations here?"
- "Design a testing strategy for our new microservice"
- "Convert these Jest tests to Vitest"

## Philosophy

The Test Architect believes in:
- Tests that provide confidence, not just coverage percentages
- Fast feedback loops over comprehensive but slow suites
- Testing behavior, not implementation details
- Pragmatic coverage - not everything needs a test
- The test pyramid as a guide, not a rule
